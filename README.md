This repo contains items that are shared by all repositories in the Myriad Group org.

## Workflow templates

The workflow templates are github actions that you can add to your Myriad Group org repo. These action templates rely on Myriad Group org secrets, also privately managed for you.

Instructions on using org workflow templates can be found in github docs.
